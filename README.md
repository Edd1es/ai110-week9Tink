# 🐶 BugHound

BugHound is a small, agent-style debugging tool. It analyzes a Python code snippet, proposes a fix, and runs basic reliability checks before deciding whether the fix is safe to apply automatically.

## What BugHound Does

Given a short Python snippet, BugHound:

1. **Analyzes** the code for potential issues  
   - Uses heuristics in offline mode  
   - Uses Gemini when API access is enabled  

2. **Proposes a fix**  
   - Either heuristic-based or LLM-generated  
   - Attempts minimal, behavior-preserving changes  

3. **Assesses risk**  
   - Scores the fix  
   - Flags high-risk changes  
   - Decides whether the fix should be auto-applied or reviewed by a human  

4. **Shows its work**  
   - Displays detected issues  
   - Shows a diff between original and fixed code  
   - Logs each agent step

## Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running in Offline (Heuristic) Mode

No API key required.

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Heuristic only (no API)

This mode uses simple pattern-based rules and is useful for testing the workflow without network access.

---

## Running with Gemini

### 1. Set up your API key

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_key_here
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run bughound_app.py
```

In the sidebar, select:

* **Model mode:** Gemini (requires API key)
* Choose a Gemini model and temperature

BugHound will now use Gemini for analysis and fix generation, while still applying local reliability checks.

---

## Running Tests

Tests focus on **reliability logic** and **agent behavior**, not the UI.

```bash
pytest
```

You should see tests covering:

* Risk scoring and guardrails
* Heuristic fallbacks when LLM output is invalid
* End-to-end agent workflow shape

## TF Summary

The main thing students needed to understand this week was that BugHound is built more like a step by step agent workflow, not just one AI prompt giving an answer. It first looks at the code, then tries to figure out what is wrong, proposes a fix, checks how risky that fix is, and decides whether it should actually trust that output or leave it to a person. I think the biggest place students could get stuck is keeping track of which file handles each part of that flow, because the logic is spread across multiple files instead of all being in one spot. AI was helpful for getting a quick explanation of what a file or function was doing, especially when the codebase felt unfamiliar at first. At the same time, it could also be misleading because sometimes it made the system sound cleaner or smarter than it really is unless you go back and verify it in the actual code. One way I would help a student without giving away the answer is by asking them to trace one decision the agent makes, like where it decides a fix is risky, and follow that from the UI to the workflow file to the risk checker. That usually helps them understand the structure way better than just searching around randomly.
